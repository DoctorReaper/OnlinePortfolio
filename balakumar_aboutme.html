                            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
                            <h4 class="card-body">I would like a job somewhere in the engineering field. Though I don't know what specifically, 
                                I know I like to code and love to build things as well as take them apart. These are all aspects 
                                seen in jobs in the engineering department, but  I might take a look at other career choices to 
                                find which one I like bests. Though as of right now, I planning on becoming an engineer. </h4>
                            <h2>Strengths and Skills</h2>
                            <h4 class="card-body">Some of my strengths are that I learn quickly and adapt to situations easily, I don't give up 
                                easily, and am willing to do extra work in order to find a solution. An example of this would be 
                                the animations in this webpage. I started coding the page without knowing anything about what CSS 
                                animations even were but that didn't stop me from going out and researching and learning about them. 
                                Though there is still more for me to learn. Some skills I have acquired over the years are an adequate 
                                understanding of python (which I obtained from codecademy and from my teachers at Fallon Engineering Lab),
                                understanding of bootstrap, some HTML and CSS,  along with my ability to build functional structures. Though
                                this may be enough for some people for me this is just the beginning of a long road ahead.</h4>
                            <h2>Achievements</h2>
                            <h4 class="card-body">
                                Some of the things I have accomplished are learning python, using a Rasberry Pi to code a robot, complete a 
                                science fair project and complete countless video games (I have a lot of free time). I was able to get introduced 
                                to python and code a robot using python because of my mentors at Fallon Engineering Lab. I have mentioned them before
                                and I will do it again because these mentors were parents with jobs volunteering every Saturday to teach kids like me 
                                to code. I was taught many basic engineering skills by them and am very grateful for them. My science fair project was
                                something I did for a DPIE(Dublin Parents In Education) Biology course I took. We had six weeks to research and complete 
                                our topics. I chose to research the difference between different types of notetaking. I was unable to get into a lab so 
                                I chose to do my research based on the evidence found in research similar to the topic. I found that taking notes by hand
                                is more effective and helps you better understand and memorize a topic versus typing your notes.

                            <h2>My Life</h2>
                            <h4 class='card-body'>
                                Throughout my life so far I have met great people and made some great friends. I have learned a lot and this is still more for
                                me to learn. From a naughty kid who moved from India to California. Learning English as a second language in school. From being 
                                very socially awkward for most of my life and now to a less socially awkward high schooler making websites (I think that is an 
                                accomplishment right there). These fourteen years have gone by pretty fast. Anyway, it isn't just me that has to keep learning, 
                                it is you, the reader as well. A good place to start might be exploring this website. Thank you for your time.
