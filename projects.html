                    <h3>Computer Science Principles: September 2018</h3>
                    <h4>This is a scratch game that I made with my partner, Alex Baker. Scratch is simple to use and if used 
                    to its full potential can make some amazing things. Our game is about a box, Boxy, who gets his ball stolen
                    by Flaming Red Hair Guy (FRHG) and has to travel through his world to get it back. This game would fall under
                    the platformer category. The purpose of this projects was to introduce us to basic coding and teamwork. We saw
                    learned how coding might look like and learned to work together, communicate, and help each other out. The idea
                    for this game came from looking into other platformer games and wanting to make one ourselves. I had a great time
                    working on this project with Alex and learned a lot by making this game. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OiRCA13t8dp5dfcAvacr3pncm48R2BtnoXNxlC7fdhg/edit?usp=sharing">Link to project documentation.</a> </h4>

                    <h3>Computer Science Principles: February 2019</h3>
                    <h4>The python hangman project is something I worked on with my partner Anshul. Python is a simple but powerful programming language. 
                    By itself you can create and assign, iterate through different variables to complete complex calculations. When you pair it with the different 
                    python libraries it becomes a powerhouse language that can basically do anything. This project is an example of the iterative features of python.
                    By iterating through the different words to check if the guess is in the word. Anshul had little trouble with the coding for this project and
                    with his help I was able to learn many new things about the possibilities in python using iterations. <a href="https://ide.c9.io/overlordsai/csp2-balakumar-s-python">Link to python workspace</a> </h4>

                        <h2>Solar-Hydrogen Vehicle</h2>
                        <h3>Principles of Engineering: November 2019</h3>
                        <h4>This project that I had worked during my time in the Principles of Engineering course was very intriguing and fun to build.
                        I worked on it with my three teammates, Alex Woods, Kade Angell, and Eeshan Walia. The basis of this project was to create 
                        a motor powered vehicle that will be able to utilise a solar panel and hydrogen cell as a power source (separately). We then were asked
                        to compare the results of the different power sources on the vehicle and create a hypothesis on the usability of the power source.
                        We faced many challenges in building this vehicle transforming it from our initially designed vehicle to our final prototype. 
                        One major hindrance was our choice to experiment with a beveled gearbox. Not only did the cause lots of friction leading to our 
                        vehicle being unable to move, it also caused us to lose time in this project. However once we had identified the problem as the gear box
                        itself we were able to quickly change it out and continue with our project. I played the role of a trouble shooter and mechanical engineer.
                        I assisted in the overall designing and building of the vehicle but also helped in solving some of the issues present in our unrefined prototype. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wEIes9-bLRj9eVwLbZgGEdcRU3YUkfPUovZC2jYHXBk/edit?usp=sharing">Link to project documentation.</a> </h4>

                        <h3>Dublin High School: Spring 2019</h3>
                        <h4>This project that my friends and worked on for an engineering competition at our school. This might seem repetitive to the other pages
                            but this project focuses on the real world problem of the constantly running water heater. The concept is that through machine learning an easily installed device
                            would learn your hot water usage patterns and turn the water heater on as needed. This greatly reduces the use of fossil fuels and emissions
                            caused by the running of the water heater as well as save the consumer money. We plan to improve this into a finalized product that could actually be
                            sold in the market. My role in this project was sales and overall management. I kept in track how much energy we would be saving, how our product
                            might do in the market and made sure that we were on track of goal. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1--BTDFyspXMYDpVJkTbDEHBZ1PRs1r0k">Link to project documentation.</a> </h4>
