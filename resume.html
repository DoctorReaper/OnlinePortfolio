            <h6>Career Goal:</h6>
            <p>My career goal is to become an engineer and bring change a major change 
            to the world. I am interested in becoming a mechanical engineer or software engineer. 
            I would like to create something that is the modern phone, something that changes
            the way the world works.</p>
            <h6>Education:</h6>
            <p>I am currently a Freshman at Dublin High School. This is my first year at this
            school but have been studying in Dublin for 5 years. This is my first year doing any 
            web development but have prior expirience with python. The biggest problem I have with coding
            is remebering the syntax, or sometimes knowing the proper commands.</p>
