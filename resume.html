                <h2>Career Goal:</h2>
                <h4 class="card-body">My career goal is to become an engineer and bring a major change to the world.
                    I am interested in becoming an engineer, though I am unsure on specifically what type of engineer 
                    because there is just so many categories and fields to chose from. As an engineer, I would like to 
                    create something that is the modern phone, something that changesthe way the world works. I want what
                    I create to help people all over the world. The first step in achieving that would be finding a problem 
                    to solve. Something to change and make better. Like fast food or starvation. Then I would have to go and 
                    solve it. But, my dream is to make a difference in the world.</h4>
                <h2>Education:</h2>
                <h4 class="card-body">I am currently a Freshman at Dublin High School. This is my first year at this school
                    but has been studying in Dublin for 5 years. This is my first year doing any web development but has prior 
                    experience with python. I like to learn and improve. There is much more to explore in the world and much more
                    knowledge for it to give. A goal for my education this year would be to become sufficient at Web Development 
                    and Python along with taking a look at Calculus, one of my future courses.</h4>
                <h2>Volunteering and Work Expirience</h2>
                <h4 class="card-body">I have minimal work and volunteer experience since I am only a freshman, but I have tutored
                some students over the summer of 2018. I have tutored some of the students living near me with some of my friends
                . We taught math and chess. We helped them with any confusions they had with previously learned topics as well as 
                help them understand new topics. We went over basic Pre-Algebra as well as very basic Algebra. I had lots of fun 
                teaching and I believe the kids we taught have an upper hand in school with their new knowledge.</h4>
                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <h4 class="card-body">I am sufficient at Python and have just learned HTML and CSS. I plan to learn more coding 
                languages and eventually master them. As of right now, I take a course to get certified in Tamil (my mother tongue)
                and have a language seal for French. I am pretty good at math and am currently in Algebra 2. These are all skills 
                that can help me become an engineer because an engineer needs to be able to communicate (languages), solve problems 
                (major math skills), and most importantly do his job correctly (coding is a part of engineering).</h4>
