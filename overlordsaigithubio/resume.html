              <h3>Experiences</h3>
              <h5>The majority of my work experience consists of volunteering and tutoring. Through these experiences, I found joy in helping other people and teaching the oncoming generations. However one of my most prominent experiences that would shape my career was that presented by the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy specifically the Honors Principles of Engineering course presented in the Academy. Through this course, we were introduced to various aspects of engineering from circuits to creating virtual simulations. There were many field trips on which we were introduced to the implementation of engineering in the real world. We completed many projects solidifying our understanding of topics and met numerous guest speakers that showed us possible engineering career paths.</h5><br>

              <h5>My most memorable field trip was to the Patriot Jet Team Foundation Hangar. At the hangar, we met the very friendly volunteers that run the trips to the hangar. They took us on a tour around the hangar and explained the science behind the various planes. Later we were given a lesson on aerodynamics and allowed to run a flight simulation. One of the volunteers was were talking to provided very helpful advice that I used to improve my rocket for the Aerodynamic Design Project. I loved this field trip and learned a lot about the use of engineering in rockets and planes.</h5><br>

              <h5>Along with the various field trips we also had numerous guest speakers. Of the speakers, the one I enjoyed the most was Jason Yoinski. Jason talked to us about neural networks and artificial intelligence which I already had an underlying interest in. He explained the use of neural networks in modern-day companies and walked us through the structure and basics of these neural networks. Jason was very interesting and I enjoyed listening and learning from his presentation.</h5>
